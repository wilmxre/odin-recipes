    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We love classic burger condiments as much as the next person. But what if we told you that you could spread your
        burger bun with <em>baba ghanoush</em>, top the burger patties with sun-dried tomatoes, and opt for goat cheese
        instead
        of cheddar?</p>
    <p>That's exactly what happens in these juicy chicken burgers, which are a leaner alternative to the classic
        cheeseburgers. Use this recipe as inspiration, then consider all the delicious flavor combinations you could
        create. Next up, we're trying a <em>kalamata</em> olive spread in place of the <em>baba ghanoush</em>, and
        swapping in some crumbled feta. If you're a fan of turkey burgers, opt for those instead of chicken.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 hamburger buns, split</li>
        <li>2 chicken or turkey burger patties</li>
        <li>2 chicken or turkey burger patties</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup <em>baba ghanoush</em></li>
        <li>2 (1/2-inch-thick) goat cheese rounds</li>
        <li>6 pieces sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 handfuls mesclun greens or arugula</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange a rack in the top third of the oven and heat to 350°F. Toast the buns in the oven until warmed
            through, 3 to 5 minutes; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a medium frying pan over high heat until shimmering. Add the patties and cook until the
            patties are cooked through (burgers should reach an internal temperature of 160°F), 3 to 5 minutes per side.
        </li>
        <li>Divide the baba ghanoush between the bottom buns and spread into an even layer. Top each with a chicken or
            turkey patty. Divide the sun-dried tomatoes over the patty, top with a goat cheese round, divide the greens
            over the goat cheese, and close with the top buns.
        </li>
    </ol>
